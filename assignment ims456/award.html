			<h6 class="w3-text-cyan"></h6>
			<p>Five years after his birth in London on January 28, 1922, Ungku Aziz was taken home to Batu Pahat, Johor. Since her mother, who has died since her two-year-old, all her education affect her life is from her father, Ungku Abdul Hamid bin Ungku Abduul Majid.

His wishes have brought him to London for some time due to disappointment with the family crisis that arose. Until his brother Ungku Aziz went to London to invite him back and bring Ungku Aziz himself who was then a little back home. At the time of his wife's death, Ungku Abdul Hamid was so disappointed. His affection and affection towards his beloved wife almost blindly blinded his eyes.

After his mother died in 1924, the small Ungku Aziz was raised by his father and father. Many of the sweet memories in the little time are still fresh in memory. Among them when he was with his father spent the holidays while visiting European countries.

Where does the sauce go to rice instead? So with Ungku Aziz, his paternity was inherited from his father, a Cambridge University student then. His father was able to master several languages ​​including Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit. He does not like to accentuate himself but his knowledge is not a bit. His passionate attitude makes his son Ungku Aziz so ordinary to be surrounded by various books in his home since childhood. Although far away in the region, people still love their country. He once told himself to his son Ungku Aziz that he did not want his son to become an Englishman, especially when he breathed his last.

Looking at and thinking about his future son Ungku Aziz, he has agreed to return to Johor. In his core education at Ungku Aziz, his father was so firmly assured that his beloved son grew up and lived as a Malay. So even though he was born in London, his education, however, influenced his character never to sue the integrity of his soul.</p>
